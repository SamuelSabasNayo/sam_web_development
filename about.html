            <p>
                Vibrations is one of the first courses where students learn to apply the knowledge obtained
                from mathematics and basic engineering science courses to solve practical problems. While the
                knowledge about vibrations and vibrating systems is important, the problem-solving skills
                obtained while studying vibrations are just as important. The objectives of this book are twofold:
                to present the basic principles of engineering vibrations and to present them in a framework
                where the reader will advance his/her knowledge and skill in engineering problem solving.
            </p>
            <p>
            This book is intended for use as a text in a junior- or senior-level course in vibrations. It
            could be used in a course populated by both undergraduate and graduate students. The latter
            chapters are appropriate for use as a stand-alone graduate course in vibrations. The prerequisites
            for such a course should include courses in statics, dynamics, mechanics of materials, and
            mathematics using differential equations. Some material covered in a course in fluid mechanics
            is included, but this material can be omitted without a loss in continuity.

                    <p>S. Graham Kelly received a B.S. in engineering science and mechanics, in 1975, a M.S
                        in engineering mechanics, and a Ph.D. in engineering mechanics in 1979, all from
                        Virginia Tech.
